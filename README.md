RealTimeHealthNotification_DataPipeline

Real-time alert notification system - This use case will simulate the streaming vital data of patients and building of a data pipeline to monitor vital data to alert the subscribers in real-time based on reference data. If the vital information coming from the patient is out of the normal threshold range, an alert notification will have to be sent immediately to the registered Email-ID.
